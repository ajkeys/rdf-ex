# RDF.Core

An implementation of the RDF and the basic accompanied standards for Elixir.


## Installation

The [Hex package](https://hex.pm/docs/publish) can be installed as usual:

  1. Add `rdf_core` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:rdf_core, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `rdf_core` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:rdf_core]]
    end
    ```
